    <h2>What is data structure?</h2>
    <p>
      Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operators that can be applied to the data
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Why there are so many?</h3>
    <p>
      Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialised, while others (like arrays) are more geneally used.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Why care?</h3>
    <p>
      The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
    </p>
    <p>
      You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!

    <h2>What is the class?</h2>
    <p>
      A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>
      The method to create new objects must be called constructor
    </p>
    <p>
      The class ketword creates a constant, so you cannot redefine it. Watch out for the syntax as well
    </p>

    <h2>Instance Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Instance Methods are methods that provide functionality to single particular instance
    </p>
  </article>

    <h2>Class Methods</h2>
    <p>
      The <em>static</em> keyword defines a static method for a class. Static methods are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance.  Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>One gotcha with 'this'</h2>
    <p>
      Inside all of our instance methods and constructor, the keyword 'this' refers to the object created from that class (also known as an instance)
    </p>

  <article>
    <h2>Recap</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as <strong>instances</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Classes are created with the <strong>new</strong> keyword
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>constuctor</strong> function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated
      </li>
      <li>
        Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects
      </li>
      <li>
        Class methods can be added using the <strong>static</strong> keyword
      </li>
    </ul>
