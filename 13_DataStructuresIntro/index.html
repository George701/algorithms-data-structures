    <h2>What is data structure?</h2>
    <p>
      Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operators that can be applied to the data
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Why there are so many?</h3>
    <p>
      Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialised, while others (like arrays) are more geneally used.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Why care?</h3>
    <p>
      The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
    </p>
    <p>
      You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!

    <h2>What is the class?</h2>
    <p>
      A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>
      The method to create new objects must be called constructor
    </p>
    <p>
      The class ketword creates a constant, so you cannot redefine it. Watch out for the syntax as well

    <h2>Instance Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Instance Methods are methods that provide functionality to single particular instance
