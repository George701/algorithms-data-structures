    <h2>Stacks</h2>
    <p>
      A <strong>LIFO</strong> (Last In First Out) structure!
    </p>
    <p>
      The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack
    </p>
    <h3>
      How is it used?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Think about a stack of <strong>plates</strong>, or a stack of <strong>markers</strong>, or a stack of ... <strong>anything</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      As you pile it up the last thing (or the topmost thing) is what gets removed first.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Where Stacks are used
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Managing function invocations
      </li>
      <li>
        Undo / Redo
      </li>
      <li>
        Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class='danger-text'>
      THere is more than one way of implementing a stack!
