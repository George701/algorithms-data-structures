    <h2>Selection Sort</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values
      into sorted position.

    <h3>Selection Sort Pseudocode</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to the new minimum and continue until the end of
        array.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the "minimum" is not the values (index) you initially began with, swap the two values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat this with next element until the array is sorted.
      </li>
    </ul>
