    <p>
      A method of solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of this subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It works with Overlapping Subproblems and Optimal Structure

      Overlapping subproblems
    </h3>
    <p>
      A problem is said to have <strong>overlapping subproblems</strong> if it can broken down into subproblems which are reused several times
    </p>
    <p>For example</p>
    <h5>Fibonacci Sequence</h5>
    <p>
      Every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding once
