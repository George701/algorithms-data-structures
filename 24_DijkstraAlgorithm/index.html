    <h3>The approach</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Every time we look to visit a new node, we pick  the node with he smallest known distance to visit first
      </li>
      <li>
        Once we've moved to the node we're going to visit, we look at each of its neighbors 
      </li>
      <li>
        For each neighboring node, we calculate the distance by summoning the total edges that lead to the node we're checking <i>from the start node</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        If the new total distance to a node is less than the previous total, we store the new shorter distance for that node
      </li>
    </ol>

      Dijkstra's Pseudocode
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This function should accept a starting and ending vertex
      </li>
      <li>
        Create an object (we'll call it distances) and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of infinity, except for the starting vertex which should have a value of 0
      </li>
      <li>
        After setting a value in the distances object, add each vertex with a priority of infinity to the priority queue, except the starting vertex, which should be have a priority of 0 because that's where we begin
      </li>
      <li>
        Create another object called previous and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of null
      </li>
      <li>
        Start looping as long as there in anything in the priority queue
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dequeue a vertex from the priority queue
          </li>
          <li>
            If that vertex is the same as the ending vertex - we are done!
          </li>
          <li>
            Otherwise loop through each value in the adjacency list at that vertex
            <ul>
              <li>
                Calculate the distance to that vertex from the starting vertex
              </li>
              <li>
                If the distance is less than hat is currently stored in our distances object
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Update the distances object with new lower distance
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Update previous object to contain that vertex
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Enqueue the vertex with total distance from the start node
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
