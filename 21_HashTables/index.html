    <h2>
      What is a hash table?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hash tables are used to store <i>key-value</i> pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike arrays, hash tables are <i>fast</i> for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Why should I care?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used!
