    <h2>
      What is a hash table?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hash tables are used to store <i>key-value</i> pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike arrays, hash tables are <i>fast</i> for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Why should I care?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Hash tables Introductory example
    </h3>
    <p>
      How can we get human-readability and computer readability? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Computers don't know how to find an element at index <i>pink</i>
    </p>

    <h3>
      The hash parts
    </h3>
    <p>
      To implement a hash table, we'll be using an array.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to look up values by keys, we need to convert keys into a valid array indices.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function that performs this task is called a hash function.

    <h3>
      What makes a good hash function
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fast (i. e. constant time)
      </li>
      <li>
        Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes uniformly
      </li>
      <li>
        Deterministic (same input yields same output)
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
      Prime numbers
    </h3>

    <p>
      The prime number in the hash is helpful in spreading out the keys more uniformly;
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also helpful if the array that you're putting values into has a prime length
    </p>
    <p>
      You don't need to know why. (For now...)

    const hash = (key, arrLength) => {
      let total = 0;
      const WEIRD_PRIME = 31;
      for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(key.length, 100); i++) {
        let char = key[i];
        let value = char.charCodeAt(0) - 96;
        total = (total * WEIRD_PRIME + value) % arrLength
      }
      return total;
    };

    console.log(hash('pink', 10));
    console.log(hash('orange', 10));
    console.log(hash('cyan', 10));
    console.log(hash('maroon', 10));
