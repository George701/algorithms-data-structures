    <h2>
      What is a hash table?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hash tables are used to store <i>key-value</i> pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike arrays, hash tables are <i>fast</i> for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Why should I care?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used!
    </p>

    <h3>
      Hash tables Introductory example
    </h3>
    <p>
      How can we get human-readability and computer readability? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Computers don't know how to find an element at index <i>pink</i>
    </p>

    <h3>
      The hash parts
    </h3>
    <p>
      To implement a hash table, we'll be using an array.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to look up values by keys, we need to convert keys into a valid array indices.
    </p>
    <p>
      A function that performs this task is called a hash function.

      What makes a good hash function
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fast (i. e. constant time)
      </li>
      <li>
        Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes uniformly
      </li>
      <li>
        Deterministic (same input yields same output)
      </li>
    </ol>
