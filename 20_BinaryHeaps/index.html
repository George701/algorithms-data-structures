    <h2>
      Binary Heaps
    </h2>
    <p>
      Very similar to Binary Search Tree, but with some different rules!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
    </p>

    <h3>
      Max Binary Heap
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each parent has at most two child nodes
      </li>
      <li>
        The value of each parent is <strong>always</strong> greater than its child nodes
      </li>
      <li>
        In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there is no guarantees between sibling nodes
      </li>
      <li>
        A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Why heaps are important?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are <strong>very</strong> commonly used data structure
    </p>
    <p>
      They are also use quite a bit, with <strong>graph traversal</strong> algorithms

    <h3>
      Representing the heaps
    </h3>
    <p>
      For any index of an array n...
    </p>
    <p>
      Left child is stored at 2n+1
    </p>
    <p>
      Right child is stored at 2n+2
    </p>
    <p>
      It's parent at index (n-1)/2

    <h3>
      Insert Pseudo
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Push the value into the values property on the heap
      </li>
      <li>
        Bubble up:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a variable called index which is the length of the values property -1
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a variable called parentIndex which is the floor of (index-1/2)
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep looping as long as the values element at the parentIndex is less than the values element at the child index
            <ul>
              <li>
                Swap the values of the values element at the parentIndex with the value of the element property at the child index
              </li>
              <li>
                Set the index to be the parentIndex, and start over
              </li>

    <h3>Sink Down</h3>
    <p>
      The procedure for deleting the root from the heap (effectively extracting the maximum element in a max-heap or the minimum element in min-heap) and restoring the properties is called down-heap (also known as bubble-down, percolate-down, sift-down, trickle-down, heapify-down, cascade-down, and extract-min/max)
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>Removing</h3>
    <h5>(Also known as extractMax</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Swap the first value in the values property with the last one
      </li>
      <li>
        Pop from the values property, so you can return he value at the end.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have the new root "sink down" to the correct spot...
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your parent index starts at 0 (root)
          </li>
          <li>
            Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
          </li>
          <li>
            Find the index of the right child: 2 * index + 1 (make sure its not out of bounds)
          </li>
          <li>
            If the left or right child is greater than the element...swap. If both left and right children are larger, swap with the largest child
          </li>
          <li>
            The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element
          </li>
          <li>
            Return the old root.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
