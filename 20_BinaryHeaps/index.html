    <h2>
      Binary Heaps
    </h2>
    <p>
      Very similar to Binary Search Tree, but with some different rules!
    </p>
    <p>
      In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes
    </p>

    <h3>
      Max Binary Heap
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each parent has at most two child nodes
      </li>
      <li>
        The value of each parent is <strong>always</strong> greater than its child nodes
      </li>
      <li>
        In a max Binary Heap the parent is greater than the children, but there is no guarantees between sibling nodes
      </li>
      <li>
        A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Why heaps are important?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are <strong>very</strong> commonly used data structure
    </p>
    <p>
      They are also use quite a bit, with <strong>graph traversal</strong> algorithms

      Left child is stored at 2n+1

      Right child is stored at 2n+2
