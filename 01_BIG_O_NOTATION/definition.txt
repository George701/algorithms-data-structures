We say that algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations
the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n),
as n increases.

-) f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n)
-) f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n.pow(2))
-) f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1)
-) f(n) could be something entirely different

Simplyfying Big O Expressions

-) O(2n) -> O(n)
-) O(500) -> O(1)
-) O(13n.pow(2)) -> O(n.pow(2))
-) O(n+10) -> O(n)
-) O(1000n+50) -> O(n)
-) O(n.pow(2) + 5n + 8) -> O(n.pow(2))

Thumbs rules

-- Time Complexity --
1. Arithmetic operations are constants
2. Variable assignment is constant
3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or by key is constant
4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop
-- Space Complexity --
5. Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
6. String require O(n) space (when n is the string length)
7. Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for object)
