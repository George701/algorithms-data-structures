SOLEVE THE PROBLEM If you can't SOLVE A SIMPLER PROBLEM!

1) Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
2) Temporarily ignoring that difficulty
3) Write a simplified solution
4) Then incorporate that difficulty back in

function charCount(str){
  let result = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
    let char = str[i]
    if (result[char] > 0) {
      result[char]++
    } else {
      result[char] = 1; 
    }
  }
  // make an object to return at the end
  // loop over string, for each char
    // if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
    // if the char is number/letter AND is not in the object, add it and set value to 1
    // if char is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything
  // return object at the end
  return result;
}
